                Alecia and her family came to Rapids not too long ago. They went down the river with our instructor, David. When they got back to the site they said "It was the best time that I have had in a while and David did a great job of leading us down the river and through the rapids."

                The Morell company came here about three years ago for a company retreat. They had our instructor, Scott, with them. When they came back, they said "This is exactly what we needed."

                Jim and Candice came here on their first date. Apparently, Jim has been here multiple times, but this was Candice's first time even going down rapids. We were glad that we were able to provide a safe and fun trip for her.
